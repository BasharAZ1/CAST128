README File: Encryption-Decryption using CAST-128 with McEliece cryptosystem and EL-GAMAL signature on SMS Text Messages between 2 Clients
This program is a Java-based implementation of encryption-decryption using CAST-128 with McEliece cryptosystem and EL-GAMAL signature on SMS text messages between two clients. The program features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using Scene Builder and implements the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm for secure key exchange.

Prerequisites:
Java Development Kit (JDK)
JavaFX
Setup:
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Install the required dependencies (JavaFX).
Run the project.
Usage:
The program opens with the GUI displaying a chat page for both clients.
The clients can exchange SMS text messages securely using the GUI.
The program implements the CAST-128 encryption algorithm and the McEliece cryptosystem for secure message transmission between the two clients.
The program also implements the EL-GAMAL signature for message authentication between the two clients.
Note: The program does not use a database for storing user information or message history.
